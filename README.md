# wheat-dotplot
This pipeline uses nucmer to generate genome alignment plots for wheat. To reduce computation time, an approach developed by Daniela Miller is used where the reference assembly is first split into its 21 chromosomal sequences, and the full genome query is aligned to each chromosome reference.
